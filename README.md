📚 School Management System in C
🔰 A simple project I built as a student to practice file handling, structures, and functions in C.

🧠 What It Does:
This is a console-based C program that helps manage student data.
It uses file handling to save and retrieve data even after the program is closed.

✅ Features:
🔹 Add a new student

🔹 Show All student records

🔹 Search by Roll Number

🔹 Search by Name

🔹 Modify a student’s data

🔹 Delete a record

🔹 Saves data to a file using fwrite / fread

📁 Technologies Used:
💻 C language

📂 File handling (fopen, fwrite, fread)

🔄 Structures (struct)

🔁 Loops and Conditionals

🧩 Menu system using switch-case
